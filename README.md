# Solar-Powered Water Trash Collector - Hardware Project

This project aims to design and implement an Arduino-based automated system to collect floating water waste. It is powered using solar energy for sustainable operation and controlled remotely using a Bluetooth module connected to a mobile phone.

## Features
- **Eco-Friendly Design**: Operates entirely on solar energy.
- **Remote Control**: Integrated Bluetooth module to control speed and direction via smartphone.
- **Arduino-Based Control**: Central control system using Arduino.
- **Manages Water Waste**: Effective for collecting trash from the surface of water bodies.

## My Contributions
- Conducted detailed **research and literature survey**.
- Created and submitted the **synopsis and presentation slides**.
- Took the lead in **hardware model design and implementation**.
- Interfaced **Bluetooth module with Arduino** and managed code for motion control.
- Documented all phases and actively collaborated in team discussions and troubleshooting.

## Technologies Used
- Arduino UNO
- Bluetooth HC-05
- DC Motors
- Solar Panel
- Motor Driver (L298N)

## Team Size
